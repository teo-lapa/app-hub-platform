# 24-48 Hour Delivery Throughout Switzerland: The LAPA Logistics Service

## The Speed That Makes the Difference

In the professional restaurant sector, time is a crucial factor. A missing ingredient can compromise an entire service, a delivery delay can mean having to modify the menu at the last minute, with negative consequences on customer experience and the establishment's reputation. For this reason, LAPA has made speed and reliability in deliveries one of the fundamental pillars of its service.

LAPA's 24-48 hour delivery system covers the entire Swiss territory, from large cities to small mountain centers, ensuring that every restaurateur can access Italian products of excellence with certain and reliable times. This service is not simply a commercial promise, but the result of a sophisticated logistical organization, significant investments in infrastructure and a constant commitment to operational excellence.

## How the LAPA Delivery System Works

The LAPA delivery system is designed to be simple for the customer and at the same time extremely efficient from an operational point of view. The process begins when the restaurateur places an order through one of the available channels: the online platform, by phone or via the dedicated mobile app.

Orders received before 3:00 PM are processed the same day and are ready for shipment. LAPA's computer system automatically optimizes the delivery route, aggregating orders by geographical area and planning the most efficient routes to reduce delivery times and minimize environmental impact.

Each order is prepared with extreme care in LAPA distribution centers. Specialized staff picks products from different warehouse departments - dry products, refrigerated, frozen, wines - and packages them using appropriate insulating and refrigerant materials to ensure that each item arrives in optimal conditions.

## The Three Strategic Distribution Centers

To ensure comprehensive coverage and fast delivery times throughout Swiss territory, LAPA operates through three strategically positioned distribution centers:

**Zurich - Hub for German-Speaking Switzerland**: The Zurich distribution center, the largest in the LAPA network with over 3000 square meters, serves all of German-speaking and central Switzerland. From here dozens of deliveries depart daily to restaurants, pizzerias and hotels from the Lake Constance region to the Grisons valleys. This center is equipped with the most modern refrigeration technologies and warehouse management systems that allow managing an inventory of thousands of products with perfect rotation.

**Geneva - Service for French-Speaking Switzerland**: The Geneva center is the reference point for all restaurateurs in French-speaking Switzerland. Strategically positioned in the Lake Geneva area, this hub effectively serves not only Geneva city, but also Lausanne, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and the entire Lake Geneva arc to Valais. The proximity to the French border also allows quickly receiving fresh supplies directly from some northern Italian producers.

**Lugano - The Bridge to Italy**: The Lugano center has a privileged position to serve Ticino and receive goods from Italy. Being the region closest to the Italian border, Lugano often functions as the first arrival point for many fresh products that are then also redistributed to the other LAPA centers. This hub serves not only restaurants in Ticino, but also supports rapid deliveries in some areas of southern Grisons.

## The Fleet of Refrigerated Vehicles

The heart of the LAPA logistics system is its fleet of specialized transport vehicles. All LAPA vehicles are equipped with professional refrigeration systems that maintain differentiated temperatures depending on the type of product transported. Vehicles are divided into compartments with independently controlled temperatures:

- Frozen compartment: constantly maintained at -18°C
- Refrigerated compartment: temperature between 0°C and 4°C for dairy products, meats and fresh products
- Controlled temperature compartment: between 8°C and 12°C for products like some aged cheeses and cured meats
- Room temperature compartment: for dry products, wines and preserves

Each vehicle is equipped with a GPS system that allows the operations center to monitor the position and status of each delivery in real time. Customers can be informed with precision about the expected arrival time and receive notifications when the vehicle is approaching.

## Cold Chain Management

One of the most critical aspects in distributing quality food products is maintaining the cold chain. LAPA has implemented rigorous protocols that guarantee that each product always maintains optimal temperature from the moment it leaves the producer until delivery to the customer.

When products arrive at LAPA distribution centers from Italy, they are immediately checked to verify that temperature has been correctly maintained during transport. They are then quickly stored in appropriate cold cells, where they remain until the moment of order preparation.

During order preparation, staff works in air-conditioned environments and uses refrigerated carts to minimize the time products are exposed to non-optimal temperatures. Packaging uses high-quality insulating materials and, when necessary, refrigerant elements such as gel packs or dry ice.

Drivers are specifically trained on cold chain management and have precise instructions on how to handle deliveries to minimize product exposure to inadequate temperatures. This includes, for example, planning stops and the order of deliveries to ensure that the most sensitive products are delivered first.

## Deliveries in Mountain Areas and Difficult Locations

One of the most complex logistical challenges in Switzerland is delivery in alpine areas and mountain locations, particularly relevant for LAPA given that many high-quality restaurants are located in mountain tourist areas. LAPA has developed specific expertise to manage these complex deliveries.

During winter months, all vehicles in the LAPA fleet are equipped with winter tires and snow chains. Drivers receive specific training on driving in alpine conditions and know the routes thoroughly, including alternative routes in case of road closures.

For some particularly remote or high-altitude locations, LAPA has established partnerships with local couriers who know the territory perfectly and can guarantee the last mile of delivery even in difficult weather conditions. This ensures that even a restaurant at 2000 meters altitude can receive its fresh Italian products with the same reliability as an establishment in the center of Zurich.

## Flexibility in Delivery Times

LAPA understands that each restaurant has its specific needs in terms of goods receiving times. Many restaurants prefer to receive deliveries early in the morning, before the start of lunch service, while others prefer early afternoon. For this reason, LAPA offers flexible time slots and, when possible, can agree on specific times with customers who have particular needs.

For regular customers, LAPA can establish fixed delivery days and times, creating a routine that simplifies inventory management for the restaurateur. For example, a restaurant can have fixed deliveries every Tuesday and Friday morning, knowing exactly when products will arrive and being able to plan accordingly.

## The Order Tracking System

Transparency is fundamental in logistics service. For this reason, LAPA has implemented a comprehensive order tracking system that allows customers to always know where their goods are.

After placing the order, the customer receives a confirmation email with all details: products ordered, total price, expected delivery day. On the delivery day, the system sends a notification when the order is loaded onto the vehicle for shipment, and another notification when the driver is approaching the establishment.

Through the reserved area on the LAPA website or via the mobile app, customers can view the status of all their current orders, see the history of previous deliveries and access documentation such as delivery notes and invoices.

## Emergency Management and Express Orders

Despite careful planning, in the restaurant sector unforeseen events can always occur: an unplanned special event, a delivery from another supplier that doesn't arrive, an unexpected success of a dish that exhausts ingredients earlier than expected.

For these situations, LAPA offers an express order service that, upon request and where logistically possible, allows receiving products even on the same day as the order. This service is particularly appreciated by customers who operate in tourist locations where demand can vary rapidly based on factors such as weather or local events.

The emergency service is managed by a dedicated team that evaluates the feasibility of the express order, identifies the optimal logistical solution (which may include using special couriers or modifications to already planned delivery routes) and coordinates the operation to ensure that the customer receives products in the shortest possible time.

## Sustainability in Logistics

LAPA is aware of the environmental impact of logistics activities and is actively working to make its delivery system increasingly sustainable. Initiatives include:

**Route optimization**: The route planning software is constantly optimized to reduce kilometers traveled, intelligently aggregating deliveries and minimizing empty returns.

**Fleet renewal**: LAPA is progressively renewing its fleet with lower environmental impact vehicles. New vehicles comply with the latest emissions regulations and have significantly reduced consumption. The goal is to progressively transition to a completely electric or hydrogen-powered fleet by 2030.

**Sustainable packaging**: Packaging materials used for deliveries are increasingly sustainable. LAPA is reducing the use of single-use plastic, favoring recyclable and biodegradable materials. Isothermal containers are reusable and are collected during subsequent deliveries.

**Shipment consolidation**: Where possible, LAPA encourages customers to consolidate orders to reduce the number of necessary deliveries, offering incentives for orders that allow optimizing trips.

## The Staff: The True Added Value

Behind the efficiency of the LAPA logistics system is above all the work of dedicated and professional people. LAPA drivers are not simple drivers, but true brand ambassadors with customers. Many of them have worked for LAPA for years and have built personal relationships with the restaurateurs they serve.

Each driver receives in-depth training not only on safe driving and vehicle management, but also on knowledge of transported products, quality maintenance procedures and customer service. They are instructed to treat each delivery with the utmost care, as if they were transporting their own products for their own restaurant.

The staff in distribution centers, responsible for order preparation, is equally fundamental. Their experience allows preparing each order with precision, minimizing errors and ensuring that products are optimally packaged for transport.

## Quality Control and Complaint Management

Despite all protocols and attention to detail, problems can occasionally occur: a product damaged during transport, a missing item, a delayed delivery. LAPA has implemented a complaint management system that is oriented toward rapid resolution and customer satisfaction.

Each delivery includes a document that the customer can verify upon receipt. If any problem is detected, the customer can immediately contact LAPA customer service, active during all delivery hours. The team is authorized to make immediate decisions to resolve the problem: sending a replacement product on the same day, immediate credit to the customer's account, or any other appropriate solution.

LAPA carefully monitors all complaints to identify patterns and areas for improvement. Each problem is analyzed to understand the cause and implement corrective actions that prevent similar situations from recurring.

## Restaurateur Testimonials

Marco Bellini, chef-patron of a renowned trattoria in Basel, says: "LAPA's 24-48 hour delivery has revolutionized the way I manage my restaurant. Before I had to order a week in advance and keep large stocks. Now I order what I need and know it will arrive quickly. This allows me to always have the freshest products and adapt the menu according to season and availability without stress."

Sophie Marchand, owner of an Italian bistro in Lausanne, adds: "What I appreciate most is reliability. In three years of collaboration with LAPA, I can count on one hand the times there have been problems, and in each case they were resolved immediately. Knowing that I can count on LAPA gives me enormous peace of mind in daily management."
