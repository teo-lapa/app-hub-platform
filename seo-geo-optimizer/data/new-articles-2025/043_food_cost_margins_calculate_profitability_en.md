## Introduction

Food cost is the percentage ratio between raw material costs and sales revenue. A restaurant with 35% instead of 28% food cost loses approximately 70,000 CHF annually on 1 million revenue.

## Food Cost Calculation

### Basic Formula
```
Food Cost % = (Raw Material Costs / Sales Revenue) × 100
```

**Example**:
- Raw material costs month: 28,000 CHF
- Sales revenue: 100,000 CHF
- Food Cost %: 28%

### Food Cost per Dish

**Pasta Carbonara**:
- Pasta (400g): 0.80 CHF
- Guanciale (80g): 2.40 CHF
- Eggs (2): 0.60 CHF
- Pecorino (40g): 1.20 CHF
- Spices, oil: 0.15 CHF
- Bread: 0.40 CHF
- **TOTAL**: 5.55 CHF

Sale price: 24 CHF
Food Cost %: 23.1%

## Target Values by Category

- **Trattoria**: 28-32%
- **Fine Dining**: 30-35%

## Pricing Strategy

### Markup Method

```
Sale Price = Food Cost × Markup
```

**Standard Markups**:
- Fast Casual: 3.0-3.5x
- Casual Dining: 3.5-4.0x
- Fine Dining: 4.0-5.0x

**Example**:
Risotto Food Cost: 6.50 CHF
Markup 4x = 26 CHF sale price

## Inventory Control

### Perpetual System

**Continuous Recording**:
- Input: every purchase recorded
- Output: every use registered
- Real-time inventory

**Software**:
- MarketMan (150-300 CHF/month)
- BlueCart (80-200 CHF/month)
- Upserve (100-250 CHF/month)

### Physical Inventory

**Frequency**:
- Weekly: Fresh products
- Bi-weekly: Dairy
- Monthly: Dry goods, wines

**Formula**:
```
Food Cost = (Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory) / Sales
```

## Waste Reduction

### Waste Types

**Pre-Production (30-40%)**:
- Product expiration
- Inadequate storage
- Over-ordering

**Production (25-35%)**:
- Preparation waste
- Kitchen errors
- Excessive portions

**Post-Production (25-35%)**:
- Plate returns
- Non-recoverable leftovers

### Anti-Waste Measures

**Smart Purchasing**:
- Order based on sales forecasts
- Multiple weekly deliveries (fresh in small quantities)
- Avoid "safety" orders

**Optimal Storage**:
- Strict FIFO system
- Labeling with receipt and expiration dates
- Correct temperatures
- Airtight containers

**Complete Utilization**:
- Waste reuse: broth from bones
- "Recovery" menu with near-expiry ingredients
- Donations: Too Good To Go, charities

**Portion Control**:
- Standardized recipes with precise weights
- Kitchen scales
- Staff training
- Calibrated plates/containers

**Target**: Reduce waste from 8-10% to 4-5%

## Supplier Management

### Price Negotiation

**Negotiation Levers**:
- **Volume**: Annual contracts guaranteed volumes → 8-15% discount
- **Payment**: Cash payment → 2-3% additional
- **Exclusivity**: Single supplier per category → negotiating power
- **Seasonality**: Buy when product abundant → -20-40%

### Supplier Comparison

Excel sheet with key products (20-30 items = 60-70% purchases):

| Product | Supplier A | Supplier B | Best |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Parmigiano 24m (kg) | 22.50 | 21.80 | B |
| Olive oil EVO (L) | 15.00 | 14.50 | B |
| Peeled tomatoes (kg) | 2.80 | 2.70 | B |

- Annual contract re-negotiation
