## Introduction
HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) is mandatory for all Swiss catering establishments. Non-compliance: fines 500-20'000 CHF, temporary closure severe cases.

## 7 HACCP Principles
1. **Hazard analysis**: Biological (bacteria), chemical (cleaners), physical (glass)
2. **Critical control points (CCP)**: Cooking >72°C, refrigeration <5°C
3. **Critical limits**: Temperatures, times, pH defined
4. **Monitoring**: Daily temperature recordings
5. **Corrective actions**: Non-compliance procedures
6. **Verification**: Monthly internal audits
7. **Documentation**: HACCP manual, registers, certificates

## Temperature Control
**Storage**: Refrigerators 0-5°C (check 2x/day), freezers -18°C
**Cooking**: Poultry 75°C, ground meat 70°C, fish 63°C, pizza 72°C center
**Cooling**: 60°C → 20°C in 2h, then 20°C → 5°C in 4h

## Personal Hygiene
- Clean uniforms daily
- Hand washing: Entry, after toilet, every 30 min, activity change
- Hair tied + cap
- Short clean nails, no jewelry
- Wounds with blue plaster + glove

**Training**: All employees basic hygiene course 4-8h, certificate valid 5 years

## Cleaning
**Daily**: Work surfaces, cutting boards, utensils, floors
**Weekly**: Refrigerators, shelves, hood filters
**Monthly**: Deep cleaning equipment, warehouse

**Products**: Only certified food-grade cleaners/disinfectants

## Allergens
**14 major allergens**: Gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soy, milk, tree nuts, celery, mustard, sesame, lupins, mollusks, sulfites

**Communication**: Menu symbols, "Allergen info on request", staff training, separate preparation if requested

## Traceability
**Registers**: Each delivery with date, supplier, product, batch, expiry
**Tracking**: From served dish to raw material batch in <4h

## Cantonal Inspections
**Frequency**: 1-2x/year without notice
**Check**: Temperatures, hygiene, labeling, HACCP documentation, allergens, pest control

**Classification**: A (Excellent), B (Good), C (Sufficient), D (Insufficient - immediate closure possible)

**Fines**: Minor 500-2'000 CHF, Medium 2'000-8'000 CHF, Serious 8'000-20'000 CHF + closure

## HACCP Manual
**Mandatory content**: Activity description, premises plan, hazard analysis, CCP identification, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, training plan, cleaning plan, supplier management, allergen management

**Update**: With any significant change (new product, process, equipment)

## Conclusion
HACCP protects customers and business. Strict compliance avoids health risks, reputation damage, fines and closures. Time investment: 4-8h/month management.
