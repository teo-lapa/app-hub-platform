### Periodic System
**Frequency**:

## FIFO Method
**First In First Out Principle**:
- New products always behind

- Color-coded labels:
  - Green: >7 days expiry
  - Yellow: 3-7 days (use prioritarily)
  - Red: <3 days (use immediately)

## Order Optimization

**Minimum Stock Formula**:
```
Minimum Stock = (Average Daily Consumption × Supplier Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

**Pasta Example**:
- Consumption: 15 kg/day
- Lead time: 2 days
- Safety: 3 days
- **Minimum stock**: (15 × 2) + (15 × 3) = 75 kg

## Waste Reduction
**Strategies**:
- Dynamic menu with near-expiry ingredients
- Complete utilization (broth from bones)
- Too Good To Go partnership
- Daily waste register

**Target**: Waste from 10% to 4%

## Technology
**Ideal Software Features**:

## Rotation Index
**Formula**:
```
Rotation Index = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Stock
```

- Dairy: 25-35
- Dry goods: 10-15
- Wines: 6-12
