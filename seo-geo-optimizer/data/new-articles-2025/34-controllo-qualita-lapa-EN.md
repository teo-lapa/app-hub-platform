# LAPA Quality Control: Excellence at Every Level of the Supply Chain

## Quality as a Fundamental Value

For LAPA, quality control is not a sporadic activity or simple formal compliance, but the beating heart of the entire business operation. Every product that enters the LAPA catalog, every selected supplier, every delivery that leaves the distribution centers passes through rigorous quality control protocols that guarantee restaurateurs authentic, safe products of constant excellence.

The LAPA quality control system is articulated on multiple levels, from the initial selection of producers to the final delivery to the customer, creating a network of verifications that ensures high standards at every phase of the chain.

## Selection and Qualification of Producers

The first and most important level of quality control occurs in the selection of producers. LAPA doesn't simply purchase products from third-party catalogs, but establishes direct relationships with Italian producers who share the company values of quality, authenticity and passion.

The qualification process for a new producer includes several rigorous phases. First, the LAPA quality team conducts in-depth research on the producer: company history, production methods, certifications held, market reputation. Only producers who pass this first documentary evaluation proceed to the next phase.

This is followed by a direct visit to the producing company. LAPA experts personally visit production sites in Italy, inspecting facilities, observing production processes, verifying hygiene and sanitary conditions, speaking directly with production managers and often also with the artisans who work the products.

During the visit, product samples are taken and brought to Switzerland for thorough testing. These samples undergo tastings by the LAPA team and often also by partner chefs who can evaluate the product from the perspective of professional kitchen use. Only if the product passes all these tests is the producer qualified and can their products enter the LAPA catalog.

## Incoming Goods Controls

When products arrive from Italy at LAPA distribution centers, another level of control begins. Each delivery is systematically inspected before being accepted and stored.

The first check concerns transport conditions. The temperatures of refrigerated vehicles are verified to ensure the cold chain has been properly maintained. Frozen products must be at -18°C, refrigerated products between 0 and 4°C. If the temperature is not compliant, the entire batch is rejected.

Subsequently, each package is visually inspected. It is verified that packages are intact, without damage, suspicious swelling or other signs of compromission. It is checked that labels correctly report all mandatory information: ingredients, allergens, expiration dates, production batch, nutritional information.

Then more in-depth sampling checks are performed. A percentage of products is opened and inspected: it is verified that the content corresponds to what is declared on the label, that organoleptic characteristics (appearance, color, consistency, smell) conform to expected standards.

All these checks are documented digitally in the LAPA management system. If non-conformities are detected, a report to the producer is immediately opened and, if necessary, the entire batch is rejected. LAPA maintains detailed statistics on the quality performance of each supplier.

## Optimal Management and Storage

Once incoming checks are passed, products are stored in LAPA warehouses according to rigorous protocols that preserve quality until delivery to the customer.

Each product category has its optimal storage environment. The three LAPA distribution centers have different types of controlled environments:

- **Freezer cells** constantly maintained at -18°C for frozen products
- **Refrigerated cells** between 0 and 4°C for meats, fresh dairy products, fresh pasta
- **Temperature-controlled cells** between 8 and 12°C for aged cheeses and some cured meats
- **Climate-controlled warehouses** at room temperature but with controlled humidity for dry products
- **Wine cellar** with constant temperature of 14-16°C and 70% humidity for optimal wine storage

Each cell is equipped with continuous temperature and humidity monitoring systems, with automatic alarms that alert staff if parameters exit acceptable ranges.

Stock rotation strictly follows the FIFO principle (First In, First Out): products that arrived first are sold first, minimizing the risk of expiration. The IT system automatically manages this rotation.

## Pre-Shipment Checks

Before an order leaves the distribution center, it undergoes further verifications. Staff preparing the order is trained to inspect each product during picking. They visually verify package integrity, check expiration dates and ensure that quantity and product type correspond exactly to what the customer ordered.

Packaging for shipment follows specific protocols that ensure products arrive at the customer in optimal conditions. Fragile products are protected with cushioning materials, refrigerated products are packaged with cooling gels in insulated containers.

## Continuous Staff Training

Quality doesn't depend only on procedures and technologies, but above all on the people who apply them. For this reason LAPA invests significantly in continuous training of all personnel involved in the quality chain.

Purchasing managers and buyers regularly participate in updating courses on food regulations, production techniques, recognition of gastronomic excellence. They visit industry fairs in Italy and participate in expert-led tastings.

Warehouse staff receives specific training on HACCP, cold chain management, recognition of non-conforming products, correct food handling. This training is updated annually.

## Non-Conformity Management

Despite all preventive checks, quality problems can occasionally occur. LAPA has a structured non-conformity management system that provides for immediate actions and root cause analysis.

If a customer reports a quality problem, LAPA customer service immediately registers the report in the system. Simultaneously, an immediate resolution procedure is activated: sending a replacement product, return and refund, or other solution agreed with the customer.

In parallel, an investigation is launched to understand the cause of the problem. All non-conformities are recorded and statistically analyzed. LAPA monitors KPIs such as return rate, number of complaints per product type, average resolution time.

## Certifications and Compliance

LAPA maintains all certifications required by Swiss and European legislation for food product distribution. Distribution centers are regularly inspected by cantonal health authorities and have always received positive evaluations.

Beyond mandatory certifications, LAPA promotes and favors producers who possess voluntary quality certifications such as:

- **PDO and PGI certifications** (Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication)
- **Organic certifications** for organic agriculture products
- **BRC or IFS certifications** (international standards for food safety)
- **Sustainability certifications** environmental and social

## Complete Traceability

A fundamental aspect of LAPA quality control is the complete traceability of each product. From the moment a product leaves the Italian producer until it arrives at the restaurant customer, every passage is digitally recorded.

Each product is identified by a batch code that allows tracing when and where it was produced, when it arrived at LAPA, in which cell it was stored, when it was shipped and to which customer.

## Innovation in Quality Control

LAPA constantly invests in new technologies and methods to further improve quality control. Recently, the company has implemented IoT (Internet of Things) systems that allow real-time monitoring of transport conditions: sensors on each vehicle continuously transmit data on temperature, humidity and vibrations.

## Conclusion: Quality as a Partnership Guarantee

The LAPA quality control system is not simply a set of internal company procedures, but a concrete guarantee for restaurateurs who choose LAPA as a partner. Knowing that each product has gone through multiple levels of verification, that it was stored in optimal conditions and that it is traceable in every passage gives restaurateurs the necessary security to focus on what they do best: creating excellent gastronomic experiences for their customers.
