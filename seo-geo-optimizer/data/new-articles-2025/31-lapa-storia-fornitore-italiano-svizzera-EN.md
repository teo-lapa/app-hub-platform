# LAPA: The Story of an Italian Excellence Supplier in Switzerland

## Since 1989: Three Decades of Passion for Italian Quality

The story of LAPA is the story of an entrepreneurial vision that transformed the landscape of Italian food distribution in Switzerland. Founded in 1989, LAPA was born from the intuition of a group of Italian gastronomy enthusiasts who saw the opportunity to bring the excellence of Italian food products to Swiss restaurateurs with uncompromising service.

In the 1980s, Italian cuisine in Switzerland was experiencing a moment of great growth. Italian restaurants were multiplying in major Swiss cities, but managers faced a constant challenge: finding reliable suppliers who could guarantee authentic products of superior quality with efficient logistics. It is in this context that LAPA was born, with the clear mission of becoming the bridge between the best Italian producers and the most demanding Swiss restaurateurs.

## The Early Years: Building Trust

The first years of LAPA's activity were characterized by a personal and direct approach. The founders personally visited hundreds of producers throughout Italy, selecting only those who could guarantee excellent quality standards and consistent production. This meticulous selection work laid the foundation for what would become LAPA's trademark: uncompromising quality.

In 1991, LAPA opened its first distribution center in Zurich, with a 500 square meter warehouse. In this space, a team of five people managed a catalog of about 200 products, serving around thirty restaurants in the Zurich area. Each order was prepared with meticulous care, each customer was followed personally. This attention to detail quickly created positive word-of-mouth in the restaurant industry.

## The 1990s Expansion: Growth and Innovation

The 1990s marked a period of significant expansion for LAPA. The company's growing reputation attracted more and more restaurateurs, and the product catalog grew rapidly to meet the diverse needs of customers. In 1995, LAPA already had over 150 active customers and a catalog of more than 800 products.

A crucial moment was the opening, in 1997, of the second distribution center in Geneva. This expansion allowed LAPA to effectively serve French-speaking Switzerland as well, a region with a strong tradition of appreciation for quality Italian cuisine. The Geneva opening required significant investment not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in staff training. LAPA has always believed that in-depth product knowledge was fundamental to offering excellent service.

During these years, LAPA also began to specialize in some product categories particularly appreciated by restaurateurs: high-quality fresh and dried pasta, PDO and PGI cheeses, traditional cured meats, extra virgin olive oil from selected producers, and Italian wines from small excellence wineries.

## The New Millennium: Technology and Tradition

The entry into the new millennium brought challenges and opportunities. LAPA understood that to continue growing and serving its customers in the best way, it was necessary to invest in technology without ever losing sight of the founding values: product quality and personalized service.

In 2003, LAPA launched its first digital catalog, allowing restaurateurs to consult the entire product range online and place orders more quickly and efficiently. This system has been constantly updated and improved over the years, becoming today a sophisticated platform that allows customers to access over 3000 products with detailed information, technical sheets and usage suggestions.

In 2006, another important step: the opening of the third distribution center in Lugano, to better serve Ticino, the most "Italian" region of Switzerland. This expansion strengthened LAPA's presence throughout Switzerland, allowing it to offer the fast delivery service (24-48 hours) that has become one of the pillars of the company's offering.

## The 2008 Crisis and Resilience

The global financial crisis of 2008 represented a testing moment for many companies in the restaurant and food distribution sector. LAPA faced this difficult period with a clear strategy: to further strengthen the relationship with existing customers and continue to invest in quality.

While many competitors cut costs by reducing product quality or service level, LAPA chose the opposite path. The company maintained quality standards unchanged, introduced greater flexibility in payment terms to help restaurateurs in difficulty, and eliminated the minimum order, allowing even small establishments to access products of excellence.

This choice, seemingly counterintuitive in a time of crisis, proved to be successful. Many restaurateurs deeply appreciated LAPA's support in difficult times, and this consolidated relationships that last to this day. Some of LAPA's most loyal customers date precisely to this period, when the company proved to be a reliable partner not only in times of prosperity, but also in difficulties.

## The 2010s: Sustainability and Specialization

The second decade of the new millennium saw LAPA evolve further, embracing themes such as environmental sustainability and total supply chain traceability. In 2012, LAPA launched the "Sustainable Supply Chain" program, which involves selecting producers who not only guarantee maximum quality, but also adopt environmentally and socially sustainable production practices.

This program led LAPA to forge even closer partnerships with Italian producers, regularly visiting farms and processing facilities to directly verify production processes. Today, LAPA can boast in-depth knowledge of every link in the supply chain for most products in its catalog.

In 2015, LAPA inaugurated a new state-of-the-art warehouse in the Zurich area, with a surface area of over 3000 square meters equipped with advanced refrigeration systems, temperature-controlled cells for specific products such as cheeses and cured meats, and a computerized logistics system that optimizes order preparation and minimizes errors.

## The COVID-19 Challenge

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 probably represented the biggest challenge in LAPA's history. With restaurants closed or operating at reduced capacity for months, many food distributors saw their revenues collapse. LAPA faced this crisis with pragmatism and creativity.

The company quickly adapted its offer, creating special packages for takeaway and home delivery, helping restaurateurs quickly convert their business model. It introduced even more flexible payment terms and kept the full staff, guaranteeing service continuity even in the most difficult moments.

Furthermore, LAPA developed a series of free webinars for restaurateurs, with experts providing advice on how to deal with the crisis, adapt the menu, manage new health regulations and exploit delivery opportunities. This support went far beyond simply supplying products, once again demonstrating that LAPA considers itself a true partner of restaurateurs.

## LAPA Today: Industry Leader

Today, over 30 years after its founding, LAPA is recognized as one of the leading suppliers of quality Italian food products in Switzerland. The company serves over 500 establishments throughout Switzerland, with a catalog of more than 3000 products selected from the best Italian producers.

The LAPA team has grown to over 50 employees, including gastronomy experts, sommeliers, logistics specialists and a multilingual customer service that speaks Italian, German, French and English. The fleet of refrigerated transport vehicles guarantees fast and safe deliveries throughout Switzerland, maintaining the cold chain and preserving product quality.

The three distribution centers in Zurich, Geneva and Lugano are equipped with the most modern storage and inventory management technologies, ensuring that each product is stored in optimal conditions and that goods rotation is always efficient.

## The Values That Guide LAPA

Over more than three decades of activity, LAPA has always maintained solid some fundamental values that guide every business decision:

**Uncompromising quality**: LAPA never compromises on product quality. Every new product that enters the catalog is tested and evaluated according to rigorous criteria. Producers are visited personally and must demonstrate that they maintain high standards consistently.

**Authenticity**: LAPA deeply believes in the importance of authenticity. This means selecting producers who follow traditional recipes, who use excellent raw materials and who respect the processing times necessary to obtain products of superior quality.

**Personalized service**: Despite the growth, LAPA has maintained a personal approach in customer relations. Each restaurateur has a dedicated contact who knows their specific needs and can provide targeted advice.

**Reliability**: Punctuality in deliveries and consistency in quality are pillars on which LAPA has built its reputation. Restaurateurs know they can count on LAPA to have the products they need, when they need them.

**Responsible innovation**: LAPA constantly invests in technology and innovation, but always in the service of improving product and service quality, never as an end in itself.

**Sustainability**: LAPA is committed to reducing the environmental impact of its operations, choosing sustainable producers, optimizing logistics to reduce emissions and minimizing waste.

## Partnerships with Italian Producers

One of the aspects that distinguishes LAPA in the market is the depth of relationships with Italian producers. LAPA is not simply a commercial intermediary, but a true strategic partner for many Italian artisan producers who see in LAPA a privileged channel to reach the Swiss market.

LAPA works with over 200 producers spread throughout Italy, from the Alps to Sicily. These producers have been selected over the years through a rigorous process that evaluates not only product quality, but also the ability to supply consistent volumes, compliance with health regulations, commitment to sustainability and passion for their craft.

Many of these partnerships have lasted for decades. LAPA has accompanied the growth of small artisan producers who have become recognized excellences in their sector. At the same time, these producers have contributed to strengthening LAPA's offering with unique products of exceptional quality.

## The Future of LAPA

Looking to the future, LAPA continues to invest in innovation and growth. The company is developing new features for the digital platform, which will allow restaurateurs to manage their orders even more effectively, access detailed nutritional information and suggestions for product use.

LAPA is also further expanding the catalog, with particular attention to emerging categories such as certified organic products, high-quality vegan and vegetarian specialties, and Italian superfoods. The goal is to continue to be at the forefront in understanding restaurant trends and providing restaurateurs with the tools to meet the increasingly sophisticated expectations of their customers.

Another area of development is the expansion of the consulting service. LAPA is creating a team of food consultants who can help restaurateurs not only in product selection, but also in menu development, cost optimization and training kitchen staff on optimal techniques for using Italian products.

Sustainability remains a strategic priority. LAPA is working to make its logistics even greener, with the goal of having a completely electric or hydrogen-powered fleet by 2030. The company is also intensifying efforts to reduce packaging and promote sustainable packaging solutions.

## Conclusion: A Story of Passion and Dedication

The story of LAPA is proof of how passion for quality, respect for tradition and constant commitment to customer service can create a successful and respected company. From the small reality of 1989 with a 500 square meter warehouse and 30 customers, LAPA has become a reference point for hundreds of restaurateurs throughout Switzerland.

But beyond the numbers and growth, what truly defines LAPA is the human approach to business. Every product in the catalog has a story, every producer is a partner with whom LAPA has built a relationship of trust, every customer is a restaurateur that LAPA supports in their daily success.

This philosophy, which has remained unchanged for over three decades, is the true secret of LAPA's success and the guarantee that the company will continue to be a reliable partner for Swiss restaurateurs in the years to come.
