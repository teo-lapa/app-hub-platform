## Introduction

The menu is a restaurant's primary sales tool, yet most restaurateurs view it merely as a list of dishes. Menu Engineering is a scientific methodology combining cost analysis, consumer psychology, and strategic design to maximize profits.

Restaurants correctly applying Menu Engineering typically see margin increases of 15-25% without raising prices or reducing quality.

## The Menu Engineering Matrix

### Dish Classification

Menu Engineering, developed by professors Kasavana and Smith in the 1980s, divides dishes into four categories based on two parameters: **popularity** and **profitability**.

**Stars**: High popularity + High margin
- Ideal dishes customers love that generate high profits
- Example: Porcini mushroom risotto (cost 4.50 CHF, price 28 CHF, 150 orders/month)
- Strategy: Actively promote, position well in menu, maintain consistent quality

**Plowhorses**: High popularity + Low margin
- Highly demanded but less profitable dishes
- Example: Margherita (cost 3 CHF, price 16 CHF, 200 orders/month)
- Strategy: Slightly increase price, reduce portions, improve presentation

**Puzzles**: Low popularity + High margin
- Profitable but rarely ordered
- Example: Sea bass fillet with herbs (cost 8 CHF, price 38 CHF, 30 orders/month)
- Strategy: Improve menu visibility, train servers to suggest, rename more appealingly

**Dogs**: Low popularity + Low margin
- Dishes that don't sell and don't earn
- Example: Basic mixed salad (cost 4 CHF, price 12 CHF, 15 orders/month)
- Strategy: Eliminate from menu or completely reformulate

### Calculating Popularity and Profitability

**Popularity Formula**:
- Popularity threshold = (Total sales category / number dishes category) × 0.7
- A dish is popular if sales exceed this threshold

**Practical example**:
- Total primi sales: 800/month
- Number primi in menu: 10
- Threshold = (800/10) × 0.7 = 56
- Dishes with >56 sales/month are popular

**Profitability Formula**:
- Contribution Margin (CM) = Sale price - Ingredient cost
- Average CM category = Sum CM all dishes / number dishes
- A dish is profitable if CM > average CM category

## Cost Analysis

### Accurate Food Cost Calculation

For each dish, document:

**Primary ingredients**:
- Carbonara pasta (400g): 0.80 CHF
- Guanciale (80g): 2.40 CHF
- Eggs (2): 0.60 CHF
- Pecorino Romano (40g): 1.20 CHF
- Black pepper: 0.10 CHF

**Secondary ingredients**:
- Oil, salt: 0.15 CHF
- Service bread: 0.40 CHF

**Garnishes**:
- Parsley, plate decoration: 0.20 CHF

**TOTAL FOOD COST**: 5.85 CHF
**Sale price**: 24 CHF
**Food Cost %**: 24.4%
**Contribution Margin**: 18.15 CHF

### Food Cost Targets by Category

**Appetizers**: 18-25%
**Primi**: 20-28%
**Meat secondi**: 28-35%
**Fish secondi**: 32-38%
**Sides**: 15-22%
**Desserts**: 15-22%
**Beverages**: 12-18%

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Models

**Cost-Plus Pricing**:
- Formula: Price = Food Cost × Markup
- Typical markup: 3.0x - 4.0x
- Example: Food Cost 6 CHF × 3.5 = 21 CHF sale price

**Value-Based Pricing**:
- Based on what customer is willing to pay
- Considers: Quality, presentation, experience, location, brand
- Example: Truffle risotto with food cost 8 CHF can justify 42 CHF

**Competitive Pricing**:
- Analyze similar competitor prices
- Position: Premium (+15-25%), Equivalent, Value (-10-15%)

### Pricing Psychology

**Eliminate currency symbols**:
- "24" instead of "CHF 24.00"
- Reduces price focus, increases orders 8-12%

**Charm pricing (ending in 9)**:
- 18.90 perceived significantly less than 19.00
- Works better for casual restaurants

**Prestige pricing (round numbers)**:
- 25 or 40 instead of 24.90 or 39.90
- Communicates quality for fine dining

**Anchor pricing**:
- Insert 1-2 very expensive dishes (45-60 CHF)
- Makes other 25-35 CHF dishes more accessible by comparison

## Menu Design

### Visual Architecture

**Golden Triangle**:
- Eye follows path: upper center → upper right corner → upper left corner
- Position Stars and Puzzles in these prime zones

**First Seconds Rule**:
- Customers tend to order first 1-2 dishes read in each section
- Insert Stars and Puzzles first in list

**Boxes and Highlights**:
- Highlight 1-2 dishes per page with boxes, colors, icons
- "Chef's Specialty", "Our Signature"
- Increases highlighted dish orders 20-30%

### Structure

**Optimal dish number**:
- 5-7 dishes per category
- Total menu: 30-50 dishes max for full service restaurant
- Bistro: 20-30 dishes
- Fine dining: 15-25 dishes

**Persuasive descriptions**:
- Use sensory adjectives: "crispy", "juicy", "aromatic"
- Storytelling: "Grandmother's recipe", "Ingredients from our Valais producers"
- Specify preparation: "slow cooked 6 hours"
- Name brand/origin: "36-month aged Parmigiano Reggiano"

## Implementation

### Menu Restructuring Step-by-Step

**Phase 1: Data Collection (2 weeks)**
- Analyze sales last 3-6 months
- Calculate precise food cost each dish
- Identify Stars, Plowhorses, Puzzles, Dogs

**Phase 2: Strategic Decisions**
- **Stars**: Maintain, possibly increase price 5-10%
- **Plowhorses**: Increase price 8-12% or reduce cost or reduce portion 10-15%
- **Puzzles**: Rename appealingly, improve description, train servers
- **Dogs**: Eliminate or replace with tested new dishes

**Phase 3: Menu Redesign**
- New layout following psychological principles
- Strategic dish positioning
- Optimized descriptions

**Phase 4: Launch and Training**
- Print new menus
- Complete staff briefing
- Emphasize target dishes for suggestions

**Phase 5: Monitoring (monthly)**

- Iterate: continuous small adjustments

### Upselling and Cross-Selling

**Server techniques**:

**Suggestive Selling**:
- "Our saffron risotto is particularly good today"
- Increases average check 12-18%

**Beverage pairing**:
- "With your sea bass, a Vermentino pairs perfectly"
- Increases wine sales 20-25%

**Ingredient upgrade**:
- "Would you like to add fresh truffle?" (+8 CHF)

**Desserts and coffee**:
- Don't ask "Would you like dessert?", but "What dessert shall I bring you? The tiramisu or panna cotta?"
- Present visual dessert cart
- Increases dessert sales from 15% to 40%

## Seasonal Menus
