# LAPA Multilingual Customer Service: Professional Support in Four Languages

## Communication Without Language Barriers

In a multilingual country like Switzerland, the ability to communicate effectively in different languages is not just added value, but a fundamental necessity. LAPA has built a multilingual customer service that speaks Italian, German, French and English, ensuring that every restaurateur can receive support in the language they feel most comfortable with.

## The Team: Multilingual and Specialized Professionals

The LAPA customer service team consists of twelve professionals, each with multiple language skills and in-depth training on Italian products and gastronomy. Most team members speak at least three of the four languages offered, ensuring flexibility and service continuity.

Each team member receives continuous training on various aspects. Beyond in-depth knowledge of the LAPA product catalog (over 3000 items), they study the characteristics of Italian PDO and PGI products, professional kitchen techniques, Swiss food safety regulations and allergies.

## Flexible Contact Channels

LAPA offers multiple channels through which customers can contact customer service:

**Phone**: A direct line active Monday to Friday from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and Saturday from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The number is the same throughout Switzerland, and the automatic system recognizes the customer's preferred language.

**Email**: Dedicated email address with guaranteed response times within 4 hours during business hours.

**Online chat**: Available on the web platform and LAPA mobile app during business hours.

**WhatsApp Business**: Increasingly popular channel for quick communications, sending product photos or information requests.

**Dedicated contact person**: Customers with significant order volumes have a dedicated sales representative.

## Pre-Sales Support and Consulting

LAPA customer service doesn't only activate when there are problems, but is a constant reference point:

**Product selection consulting**: Many restaurateurs contact LAPA for advice on which products to select.

**Tastings and samples**: For new or particularly expensive products, LAPA can organize sample shipments.

**Technical and nutritional information**: Customer service can quickly provide all this information, complete with official documentation.

**Usage suggestions**: How to best work a particular buffalo mozzarella? What is the ideal temperature to serve an aged cheese?

## Order Management

A significant part of customer service work concerns support in order management:

**Order assistance**: Even if the online platform is intuitive, some customers prefer human contact.

**Order modifications**: If a restaurateur needs to modify an already submitted order, customer service can intervene quickly.

**Delivery tracking**: The system provides automatic tracking, but customers can always call for more detailed information.

**Emergency management**: When a restaurateur has an emergency, customer service evaluates the possibility of organizing express deliveries.

## Problem Resolution and Complaints

When problems occur, LAPA customer service intervenes with an approach oriented toward rapid resolution:

**Immediate handling**: Customer service operators have decision-making autonomy to solve most problems.

**Proactivity**: If the system detects a delay or problem, customer service proactively contacts the customer.

**Follow-up**: After problem resolution, customer service recontacts the customer.

**Documentation**: Each problematic interaction is documented in detail.

## Region-Specific Language Support

LAPA's multilingual service is optimized for Swiss regional specificities:

**German-speaking Switzerland**: German-speaking operators know Schweizerdeutsch dialects.

**French-speaking Switzerland**: The French-speaking team is familiar with Romandie restaurant needs.

**Ticino and Italian-speaking Grisons**: Italian support is particularly important in these regions.

**English for international clientele**: Many Swiss restaurants have international staff.

## Continuous Training

The LAPA customer service team participates in continuous training programs:

**Product training**: Whenever a new product enters the catalog, the team receives specific training.

**Producer visits**: Periodically, team members visit producers in Italy.

**Customer service excellence**: Regular training on communication techniques, stress management, conflict resolution.

**Regulatory updates**: Continuous training on Swiss and European regulations.

## Restaurateur Testimonials

Giuseppe, chef at a restaurant in Zurich: "I really appreciate that I can speak in Italian with LAPA customer service. I feel understood not only linguistically, but also culturally."

Sophie, owner of a bistro in Lausanne: "The French support is impeccable. But what I appreciate most is that they are not only kind, they are also competent."

## Conclusion: Partners, Not Just Suppliers

LAPA's multilingual customer service represents one of the distinctive elements that transform LAPA from a simple supplier to a true partner for restaurateurs. The ability to communicate effectively in four languages, combined with professional competence and a solution-oriented approach, creates a service experience that restaurateurs deeply appreciate and that contributes to long-term loyalty.
