# No Minimum Order: The LAPA Policy That Democratizes Excellence

## Quality Accessible to All Restaurateurs

One of LAPA's most appreciated policies, and one that clearly distinguishes it from many competitors in the food distribution sector, is the absence of a minimum order. This choice, which may seem simply a commercial convenience, actually represents a deep business philosophy: the excellence of Italian products must be accessible to all restaurateurs, regardless of the size of their establishment or the volume of their purchases.

Most professional food product distributors impose a minimum order, typically between 200 and 500 Swiss francs, to economically justify delivery and management costs. This creates a significant barrier for many small restaurateurs, bistros, wine bars and niche establishments that may need only a few specific products. LAPA has chosen to completely eliminate this barrier.

## Why LAPA Chose to Eliminate the Minimum Order

LAPA's decision not to impose a minimum order was not taken lightly. It is the result of deep reflection on company values and the type of relationship LAPA wants to build with its customers. Several factors guided this strategic choice:

**Support for small establishments**: LAPA believes that even a small wine bar, an artisanal gelato shop or a family bistro deserve to have access to authentic Italian products of superior quality. These small establishments are often the most passionate ambassadors of Italian gastronomic culture, and deserve to be supported.

**Operational flexibility**: In the restaurant sector, needs can change quickly. A restaurant might urgently need just one product that has unexpectedly run out. Without the minimum order obligation, the restaurateur can order exactly what is needed, when it is needed, without having to "inflate" the order with unnecessary products just to reach a minimum threshold.

**Waste reduction**: Forcing customers to order minimum quantities often leads to purchasing products that are not immediately needed, with the risk that they go to waste if not used in time. The absence of a minimum order allows restaurateurs to manage inventory more efficiently.

**Building trust**: By eliminating the minimum order, LAPA demonstrates that it has confidence in the quality of its products and service. It knows that customers will return not because forced by commercial constraints, but because satisfied with the experience.

## Who Benefits Most from This Policy

While all LAPA customers appreciate the flexibility offered by the absence of a minimum order, some categories of restaurateurs particularly benefit from this policy:

**Small bistros and family-run establishments**: These establishments often have limited storage space and a customer volume that doesn't justify large orders. Being able to order small quantities when needed is fundamental for their operations.

**Wine bars and wine shops**: These establishments might need mainly wines and some accompanying products, without the need for large kitchen supplies. The absence of a minimum order allows them to focus on what is really needed.

**Restaurants in tourist areas**: In locations where attendance varies significantly with seasons, restaurants must be able to quickly adapt their orders to customer numbers. In low-season weeks, being able to place small orders is essential.

**New openings**: Recently opened restaurants often don't yet have a clear perception of the volumes they will need. Being able to start with small orders and increase gradually is much less risky than having to immediately commit to substantial purchases.

**Restaurants testing new products**: When a restaurant wants to try a new ingredient or dish on the menu, it makes sense to initially order small quantities to test customer reaction before making more substantial purchases.

## How It Works in Practice

LAPA's no minimum order system is extremely simple: the restaurateur can order even a single product, and LAPA will deliver it with the same care and reliability as a thousand-franc order. There are no penalties, surcharges or special conditions for small orders.

The process is identical regardless of order size:
- The customer accesses the online platform, mobile app or calls customer service
- Selects desired products, even just one
- Completes the order
- Receives confirmation via email
- Is delivered within standard 24-48 hour timeframe

There are no different price tiers, additional delivery costs for small orders or other penalties. The price of each product is the same, whether ordered alone or as part of a large order.

## Economic Benefits for the Restaurateur

Eliminating the minimum order brings significant economic benefits for restaurateurs, which go well beyond apparent convenience:

**Better cash flow management**: Not having to place large orders to reach a minimum threshold means better distributing expenses over time. A restaurateur can order what is needed when it is needed, instead of having to commit hundreds of francs in a single order.

**Reduction of tied-up inventory**: Capital invested in warehouse inventory is capital that cannot be used for other purposes. By ordering in smaller quantities more frequently, the restaurateur keeps less capital tied up in inventory.

**Less waste**: Fresh products have a limited shelf life. By ordering quantities adequate to immediate needs instead of large batches, the risk that products expire before being used is significantly reduced.

**Menu flexibility**: Being able to order small quantities of special products allows restaurateurs to offer more variety on the menu without risking being left with unused ingredients.

## Optimal Inventory Management

The absence of a minimum order allows restaurateurs to adopt more sophisticated and efficient inventory management approaches:

**Just-in-time ordering**: Instead of accumulating large stocks, restaurateurs can order products in real time based on needs, knowing that LAPA will deliver quickly even small orders.

**Integration orders**: If a product unexpectedly runs out, the restaurateur can immediately place an integration order for that single product, without having to wait for the next scheduled large order.

**Testing new products**: Wanting to experiment with a new ingredient or product doesn't require a large investment. You can order a small quantity to test, and then decide whether to include it regularly in the offering.

## Real Use Cases

**The Family Bistro in Basel**: Maria runs a small bistro with 20 seats in the old town of Basel. Her menu changes weekly based on seasonal products and creativity. "LAPA's no minimum order policy was revolutionary for me," Maria says. "I can order three jars of San Marzano tomatoes for a weekend special, or two packages of special pasta to test a new dish. Before, with my old supplier, I had to order at least 300 francs at a time, and always ended up with products I didn't really need."

**The Wine Shop in Lugano**: Pietro opened a wine bar with a small kitchen in Lugano. The focus is on wines, but he also offers charcuterie and cheese boards and some simple dishes. "70% of my budget goes to wines," Pietro explains. "For food products I need limited quantities. LAPA allows me to order only what I need: maybe two salamis, three cheeses, and a couple of preserves. With other suppliers, having to reach minimum orders forced me to buy products that I then struggled to sell before expiration."

**The Seasonal Mountain Restaurant**: Sophie runs a restaurant in a ski resort in the Vaud Alps. "In high season I order a lot, but in low-season weeks, when I'm only open on weekends, I need much smaller quantities," says Sophie. "LAPA treats me the same whether I order 50 francs or 500. This allows me to stay open even in quiet weeks without risking waste."

## The Impact on Customer-Supplier Relationship

The elimination of the minimum order has transformed the nature of the relationship between LAPA and its customers. Instead of being a purely transactional relationship, where the supplier imposes conditions and the customer must adapt, it becomes a true partnership based on mutual trust.

Restaurateurs know that LAPA is not "forcing" them to buy more than necessary. This creates a sense of freedom and appreciation that translates into long-term loyalty. Many LAPA customers, even when they grow and start placing larger orders, remain loyal precisely because of the memory of how they were treated when they were small.

## How LAPA Can Offer This Service

One might wonder how LAPA can economically sustain a no minimum order policy. The answer lies in several factors:

**Logistics efficiency**: The three strategically positioned distribution centers and the route optimization system allow LAPA to aggregate many small deliveries into efficient routes, keeping costs under control.

**Overall volume**: Even if some orders are small, LAPA's overall volume is significant. Fixed costs are distributed over a broad customer base.

**Long-term vision**: LAPA knows that supporting small customers today can mean having large customers tomorrow. Many successful restaurants that today place substantial orders started as small establishments.

**Customer loyalty**: The satisfaction generated by the absence of a minimum order creates loyal customers who order more frequently, compensating for the apparently lower margins of small orders.

## Tips for Making the Most of This Policy

LAPA suggests some ways for restaurateurs to make the most of the absence of a minimum order:

**Frequent small orders for fresh products**: For very fresh products like some cheeses or fresh pasta, it can be advantageous to place more frequent orders of smaller quantities rather than large stocks.

**Test before purchasing**: Before permanently adding a new product to the menu, order a small quantity to test quality and customer reaction.

**Seasonal orders**: For seasonal or special products, order only when actually needed instead of making advance stocks.

**Combine planned orders and emergencies**: Maintain a routine of regular orders for basic products, but know you can supplement with small urgent orders when necessary.

## Conclusion: A Choice That Makes the Difference

LAPA's no minimum order policy is not simply an operational convenience: it is a statement of values. It tells restaurateurs that LAPA believes in them, whatever the size of their establishment or the phase of their entrepreneurial journey.

In a sector where small operators often feel neglected or penalized, LAPA has chosen to put them on the same level as large customers. This democratic approach to excellence has created an extremely loyal customer base and has allowed LAPA to support a diverse community of restaurateurs throughout Switzerland.

For a restaurateur considering LAPA as a supplier, knowing there are no minimum order constraints eliminates a significant barrier. You can start with a trial order, test the quality of products and service, and then decide in complete freedom how to proceed. It is this freedom, combined with product excellence and service reliability, that makes LAPA a reference partner for hundreds of restaurateurs in Switzerland.
